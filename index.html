        <p>I originally started my career in Sports Management, but after a terrible experience with a professional football team (I won't say who, but those who know me will figure it out quickly) I decided to switch careers into Student Affairs and Sports Management.
          After 6 years of trying it out, I realized that Student Affaris wasn't the field for me.  Hence why I am now trying to be a Web Developer! <br>
          I soon came to realize that the basic HTML and CSS I learned in high school over 10 years ago, just wasn't going to cut it.  So I made the decision to quit my current job, and enroll in a program that could teach me all I need, and fast!
          Hence why I am a current student in the General Assembly Web Development Immersive!
          I look forward to all the challenges ahead of me, and what that might entail!
